         draft-origin-bound-cookies-amarjotgill-protocol-latest

Abstract

   This draft introduces Origin-Bound Cookies which updates [COOKIES]
   aiming to make cookies more secure by default through binding cookies
   by port and scheme.

1.  Introduction

   Cookies are one of the few components of the web platform that are
   not scoped to the origin by default.  This difference in scoping
   means that cookies have weaken confidentiality and integrity compared
   with other storage APIs on the web platform.

1.1.  Examples

   1.  https://somesite.com sets a simple cookie, secret=123456, which
       contains private information about a user.  Information that an
       attacker wishes to learn.  To do so the attacker man-in-the-
       middles the user, and then tricks them into visiting
       http://somesite.com (note the insecure scheme).  When the user
       visits that page their browser will send the secret cookie and
       the attacker can see it.

   2.  Similarly, if the attacker has somehow compromised a service
       running on a different port on the same server, let's say port
       345, as https://somesite.com then they could trick the user into
       visiting https://somesite.com:345, the user's browser will send
       the secret cookie, and once again the attacker can see it.  Even
       more, through the same techniques, an attacker can also modify a
       user's cookies, sending a Set-Cookie field instead of simply
       eavesdropping.

   All of these examples are possible because cookies by default do not
   care about the scheme or port of their connection.  As long as the
   host matches the cookie will be accessible.

   This document proposes changes to [COOKIES] by bounding cookies to
   port and scheme
