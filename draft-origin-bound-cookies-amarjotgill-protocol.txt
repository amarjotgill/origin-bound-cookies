1.  Introduction

   Cookies are one of the few components of the web platform that are
   not scoped to the origin by default.  This difference in scoping
   means that cookies have weak confidentiality (https://httpwg.org/
   http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-layered-cookies.html#name-weak-
   confidentiality) compared with other storage APIs on the web
   platform.

1.1.  Examples

   1.  https://somesite.com sets a simple cookie, secret=123456, which
       contains private information about a user.  Information that an
       attacker wishes to learn.  To do so the attacker man-in-the-
       middles the user, and then tricks them into visiting
       http://somesite.com (note the insecure scheme).  When the user
       visits that page their browser will send the secret cookie and
       the attacker can see it.

   2.  Similarly, if the attacker has somehow compromised a service
       running on a different port on the same server, let's say port
       345, as https://somesite.com then they could trick the user into
       visiting https://somesite.com:345, the user's browser will send
       the secret cookie, and once again the attacker can see it.  Even
       more, through the same techniques, an attacker can also modify a
       user's cookies, sending a Set-Cookie field instead of simply
       eavesdropping.

   All of these examples are possible because cookies by default do not
   care about the scheme or port of their connection.  As long as the
   host matches the cookie will be accessible.

   This document proposes changes to [COOKIES] by binding cookies to
   port and scheme which will prevent against these attacks and greatly
   improve cookie security.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

2.1.  Terminology

   An aliasing cookie refers to a cookie which shares the same cookie-
   name, cookie-value and sub domain with another cookie but differs via
   scheme or port.

   A domain cookie is a cookie which has the Domain= parameter set in
   its field.

   An origin cookie is a set of cookies which are set on each origin, an
   origin being the same port and scheme value.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  User Agent Requirements

3.1.  Origin-Bound Behavior

3.1.1.  Port Bound

   First, alter Section 5.1.2 of COOKIES (https://httpwg.org/http-
   extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-layered-cookies.html#name-cookie-
   struct) by adding source-port to the Cookie Struct, this would be
   necessary to keep track of the port the cookie was set on.

   Below is the definition of the port attribute.

   |  A cookie's port is either null or a 16-bit unsigned integer.  It
   |  is initially null.

   For port matching algorithms below will be updated to compare
   integers to ensure port values match.

   Example:

   The new behavior will behave as the following.

   A cookie set by origin https://example.com will only ever be sent to
   https://example.com(:443).  It will never be sent to a different port
   value such as https://example.com:8443.

3.1.2.  Scheme Bound

   First, alter Section 5.1.2 of COOKIES (https://httpwg.org/http-
   extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-layered-cookies.html#name-cookie-
   struct) by adding scheme to the Cookie Struct, this would be
   necessary to keep track of the port the cookie was set on.

   Below is the definition of the scheme attribute.

   |  A cookie's scheme is null or a byte sequence.  It is initially
   |  null.

   To simplify cookie-to-scheme matching, a new scheme matching concept
   will be introduced.  This is necessary because initial WebSocket
   connections, in addition to HTTP and HTTPS, can also set and send
   cookies.  To maintain WebSocket compatibility, scheme comparisons
   will look for "compatible schemes" rather than exact string matches.
   This will be achieved by adding a new section under Section 5.3 of
   COOKIES (https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-
   layered-cookies.html#name-subcomponent-algorithms).

   A string A Scheme-Matches a string B if one of the following is true:

   1.  A equals B

   2.  A and B are both in [“http”, “ws”]

   3.  A and B are both in [“https”, “wss”]

   Else they are considered incompatible.

   Example:

   The new behavior will behave as the following.

   A cookie set by origin https://example.com will only ever be sent to
   https://example.com.  It will never be sent to a different scheme
   value such as http://example.com.

3.2.  Storage

   We update the storage model in Section 5.4.3 of COOKIES
   (https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-layered-
   cookies.html#name-store-a-cookie) to ensure that port and scheme are
   being considered when comparing with existing cookies.

   Step number 18 of this section will need to be altered to:

   |  If the user agent's cookie store contains a cookie oldCookie whose
   |  name is cookie's name, host is host-equal to cookie's host, host-
   |  only is cookie's host-only, path is path-equal to cookie's path,
   |  and cookie's port or scheme is not equal to oldCookie's port or
   |  scheme, if the domain attribute is set ignore the port checking.

   Note the addition of checking port and scheme, this will prevent a
   cookie with differing port or scheme values from overwriting the
   oldCookie, instead this cookie would be stored as a separate cookie
   and the oldCookie will not be deleted.  Also note if the domain
   attribute is set then we will ignore checking via port so it will
   overwite the oldCookie.

3.3.  Retrieve Cookies

   The Retrieve Cookies algorithm will need to be updated in
   Section 5.4.5 of COOKIES (https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-
   ietf-httpbis-layered-cookies.html#name-retrieve-cookies).

   Retrieve Cookies will now take a port and scheme value.

   The following will need to be added to step 2:

   1.  port port-matches cookie's port.

   2.  scheme scheme-matches cookie's scheme.

   This will ensure that a cookie is only retrieved if the request
   origin is equal to the cookie's origin

3.4.  Cookie Store Eviction

   The last algorithm that will need to be updated is the Cookie Store
   Eviction algorithm outlined Section 5.2.2 of COOKIES
   (https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-layered-
   cookies.html#name-remove-excess-cookies-for-a).

   Step 2 will need to be updated to the following:

   |  Sort all insecureCookies by last access time (earliest to latest),
   |  prioritizing domain cookies first, followed by origin cookies.

   Step 4 will also need to be updated to the following:

   |  Sort all secureCookies by last access time (earliest to latest),
   |  prioritizing domain cookies first, followed by origin cookies.

   Updating these steps will ensure that domain cookies for each origin
   are deleted before any other cookie.

3.5.  Requirements Specific to Non-Browser User Agents

3.5.1.  The Cookie Header Field

   The cookie header field outlined in Section 5.5.2 of COOKIES
   (https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-layered-
   cookies.html#name-the-cookie-header-field) will need to be altered.

   It will be altered to the following:

   |  1.  Let isSecure be a boolean indicating whether request's URL's
   |      scheme is deemed secure, in an implementation-defined manner.
   |  
   |  2.  Let host be request's host.
   |  
   |  3.  Let path be request's URL's path.
   |  
   |  4.  Let httpOnlyAllowed be true.
   |  
   |  5.  Let sameSite be a string whose value is implementation-
   |      defined, but has to be one of "strict-or-less", "lax-or-less",
   |      "unset-or-less", or "none".
   |  
   |  6.  let port be request's URL's port.
   |  
   |  7.  let scheme be request's URL's scheme.
   |  
   |  8.  Let cookies be the result of running Retrieve Cookies given
   |      isSecure, host, path, httpOnlyAllowed, sameSite, port, and
   |      scheme.
   |  
   |  9.  Return the result of running Serialize Cookies given cookies.

   Note the major change here is extracting the port and scheme from the
   request and running the new version of Retrieve Cookies based on
   that.

4.  Security Considerations

   Origin-Bound Cookies is considered net positive for security, the
   following would be mitigated by it.

   Weak integrity: This occurs when an insecure site, controlled by a
   network attacker, sets a malicious cookie that is then sent to the
   secure version of that site.  OBC binds cookies to their setting
   origin, preventing such malicious cookies from being accessed by a
   different origin.

   Weak confidentiality: This refers to an attacker reading sensitive
   user data set by a secure site, which is unintentionally sent to an
   insecure site.  OBC ensures that cookies are only accessible by the
   same origin that set them, preventing this type of data leakage.

   One security concern is how to handle clients that do not support
   OBC, this is handled by the following, when a cookie has a valid
   Domain attribute specified (hereby called a “domain cookie”) that
   cookie has relaxed bindings.  Namely, the cookie may be sent to: 1.
   any host which domain matches the Domain value (This is unchanged
   from legacy behavior) 2. any port value

   Importantly a domain cookie is still bound to the scheme of its
   setting origin.

   This behavior allows developers to opt-out of the stronger
   protections of an origin cookie which can help with compatibility for
   usages that need a particular cookie available across hosts and/or
   ports.

4.1.  Shadowing Cookies

   A cookie that includes a Domain attribute is called a "domain cookie"
   and has more relaxed restrictions.  Specifically, it can be sent to:

   Any host that matches the specified domain.

   Any port on those hosts.

   Importantly, the cookie remains bound to the scheme (e.g., https) of
   the site that set it.  This behavior allows developers to opt-out of
   the stricter default protections, which is useful when a cookie needs
   to be shared across multiple subdomains or ports.

   The "Shadowing" Security Issue as described in
   [Cookies-Lack-Integrity] This flexibility creates a potential
   vulnerability where a secure "origin cookie" (one without a Domain
   attribute) could be overridden or "shadowed" by a less-secure domain
   cookie.  Removal for Secure could be a possible future consideration
   for the HTTP WG.

   Here's an example:

   A user visits https://trusted.example.com, which sets a secure
   cookie:

   Set-Cookie: trustedValue=1234

   Later, the user visits https://evil.example.com, which sets a
   conflicting domain cookie:

   Set-Cookie: trustedValue=evil1234; Domain=example.com

   The next time the user visits https://trusted.example.com, the
   browser will send both cookies.  The server might incorrectly process
   the malicious evil1234 cookie, leading to potential security
   problems.

   The Solution:

   To preserve the security benefits of origin cookies, this design
   disallows a domain cookie from shadowing an origin cookie.  This
   ensures that the more specific and secure cookie cannot be overridden
   by a less secure one.

5.  IANA Considerations
